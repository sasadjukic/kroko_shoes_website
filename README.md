<strong>KROKO SHOES WEBSITE</strong>
<br>
A web portal for Kroko Shoes, a family owned shoe manufacturing business. 
The page serves to introduce visitors to the business and display some of the shoes that are currently 
made and sold. Although prices are included the website does not include e-commerce features at the moment.

<strong>ABOUT</strong>
This is a simple website made with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. In addition to landing page, 
there's an about page, men collection page, and women collection page.
Conntact section includes e-mail, phone and social media, but does not feature online forms.

<strong>UPDATES</strong>
There's a plan for the website to receive updates and I might update repo when that happens.  

<strong>GITHUB REPO</strong>
The repo includes image folder but doesn't have shoes images. I included logo and icon only.
